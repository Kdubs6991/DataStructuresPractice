📚 Data Structures Practice (Java)

This repository contains my personal practice code and examples for core data structures, written in Java.
I created this project to reinforce and practice concepts for my Data Structures course and to better understand 
how these structures work both conceptually and in code.

I used examples both from youtibe videos (which are linked in their files above their code) and also examples
from ChatGPT that helped me understand certain concepts

Rather than focusing on one large application, this repository is organized as small, focused examples for each 
data structure.

Each file demonstrates:
	•	Core operations
	•	Common use cases
	•	How the data structure behaves internally

🧠 How I Study & Take Notes

Alongside coding, I took detailed handwritten concept notes using GoodNotes on my iPad.

My study process usually looks like this:
	1.	Learn the concept (ChatGPT / video)
	2.	Write visual notes (diagrams, step-by-step traces, explanations)
	3.	Implement small Java examples in code
	4.	Re-trace operations on paper to reinforce understanding

This approach helps me understand:
	•	why a data structure behaves the way it does
	•	not just how to use it

📝 Concept Notes (GoodNotes)

I keep my handwritten notes organized by topic, including:
	•	Stacks & Queues
	•	Infix → Postfix conversion
	•	Binary Trees & Traversals
	•	Binary Search Trees (insert, delete, successor)
	•	Hash Tables (chaining & linear probing)
  • And more...

These notes include diagrams, traversal walkthroughs, and step-by-step problem solving.
